\title{
 Compute Kernel and Burden Statistics for Pedigree Data (possibly
 with unrelated subjects) 
}
\description{
  Compute linear kernel and burden statistics for gene-level analysis of
  data that includes pedigree-related subjects, and possibly unrelated
  subjects.
}
\usage{
pedgene(ped, geno, map=NULL, male.dose=2,
                    checkpeds=TRUE, verbose.return=FALSE,
                    weights=NULL, weights.beta=c(1,25), weights.mb=FALSE,
                    method="kounen", acc.davies=1e-5)
}
\arguments{
  \item{ped}{A data.frame with variables that define the pedigree structure
    (typical format used by LINKAGE and PLINK), trait (phenotype), and
    optionally a covariate-adjusted trait (for covariate-adjusted gene
    level statistics). The columns in the data.frame must be named as
    follows:
    \itemize{
      \item{ped: pedigree ID, character or numeric allowed}
      \item{person: person ID, a unique ID within each pedigree, numeric
      or character allowed}
      \item{father: father ID, 0 if no father}
      \item{mother: mother ID, 0 if no mother}
      \item{sex: coded as 1 for male, 2 for female}
      \item{trait: phenotype, either case-control status coded as 1
	for affected and 0 for unaffected, or a continuous
	value. Subjects with missing (NA) will be removed from the analysis}
      \item{trait.adjusted: an optional variable for covariate-adjusted
        trait. If trait.adjusted is present in the data.frame, then
	gene-level tests are adjusted for covariates using
        residuals = (trait - trait.adjusted). Otherwise, gene-level tests
        are not adjusted for covariates, in which case
	residuals = trait - mean(trait)} where the mean is taken on all
      subjects passed into pedgene before removing subjects who do not
      have genotype data.
    }
  }
  \item{geno}{
    Data.frame or matrix with genotypes for subjects (rows) at each variant position
    (columns). The first two columns are required to be named \code{ped} and
    \code{person}, which are used to match subjects to their data in the
    \code{ped} data.frame. The genotypes are coded as 0, 1, 2 for autosomal
    markers (typically a count of the number of the less-frequent
    allele). For X-chromosome markers, females are coded 0, 1, 2, and
    males coded 0, 1. Missing genotypes (NA) are allowed.
  }
  \item{relation}{
    Optional data.frame/matrix with 4 columns (id, person1, person2, code) specifying 
	special relationships between pairs of individuals and used by the kinship 
	function. Codes are : 
		1=Monozygotic twin, 
		2=Dizygotic twin, 
		3=Twin of unknown zygosity, and
		4=Spouse. 
	The last is necessary in order to place a marriage with no children into the 
	plot. See kinship2::pedigree for details.
  }
  \item{map}{
    Optional data.frame with columns "chrom" and  "gene", one row per
    variant column in geno. The gene name can be any identifier for the
    gene. The chromosome can be either numeric or character, where the
    calculations will differ between autosomes vs X chromosome (allow
    "X"/"x"/23, converted to "X" in results)
  }
  \item{male.dose}{When analyzing the X-chromosome, male.dose defines
    how male genotypes should be analyzed. male.dose can be between 0
    and 2, but is typically either 1 or 2. Ozbek and Clayton show that
    male.dose = 2 is powerful in the presence of X-chromosome dosage
    compensation in females.
  }
   \item{checkpeds}{logical, if FALSE, the method will skip the pedigree
     checking step, which can be intensive for large studies}
   \item{verbose.return}{logical, if TRUE, return the pedigree, geno,
     and map objects used in the tests after initial cleanup, e.g., the
     removal of monomorphic variants. They are returned in the pedgene
     object in a list called "save"}
   \item{weights.beta}{ Weights based on a function of the minor allele
   frequency (maf) and the Beta distribution} 
  \item{weights}{optional user-specified weights, a vector of weights
    for each variant column of geno. If none given, the Beta weights
    are applied}
  \item{weights.mb}{logical, if TRUE and no user-given weights, apply the
    Madsen-Browning weights per variant: 1/sqrt(maf*(1-maf)). The
    hierarchy of weights used is 1) user-specified weights, 2)
    Madsen-Browning if weights.mb=TRUE and weights=NULL, 3) Beta density
    weights (default if no other weights are set)}
  \item{method}{method for calculating the kernel test p-value. Kounen's
    saddlepoint approximation (default) is based on the survey package,
    and has been found to have less faults (e.g., returned missing
    value) than  Davies' method (see Chen et al., 2012). The Davies method, 
    which computes an exact p-value for a mixture of chi-square
    distributions, is also provided. The accuracy of the Davies method
    depends on the numerical accuracy parameter (acc.davies), which can
    be difficult to specify ahead of time.}
  \item{acc.davies}{Numerical accuracy parameter used in the Davies'
    method for calculating the kernel test p-value. In some instances, a
    p-value from the kernel test is out of range, in which case the
    p-value is set to 0 or 1, depending on which direction the p-value
    was out of range.}
}
\details{
  The pedgene function is a wrapper function to call pedgene.stats on
  one gene at a time. The pedgene.stats function calculates gene-level
  tests for associations with a trait among subjects, accounting for relationships
  among subjects based on known pedigree relationships (see Schaid et al). 
  This is achieved by the kinship function in the kinship2 package. The kernel
  association statistic uses a weighted linear kernel, with default
  weights based on the beta distribution and the sample minor allele
  frequency. The burden statistic is based on a weighted sum of variants. If
  a gene only has one variant, the kernel test reduces to the burden statistic.
  Variant positions that have zero variance are removed from the
  analysis because they do not contribute information.

  Note that if ped contains extra people that are not necessary to
  define relationships of people with genotype data, their trait value will
  still be used in mean(trait) in calculating trait.adjusted if trait.adjusted is
  not given as a column in ped. 
}
\value{
  An object of the pedgene S3 class, with the following elements:
  \item{call: }{function call}
  \item{pgdf: }{data.frame with gene name, chromosome, n-variants per
    gene(after removing uncessary variants), n-variants removed per
    gene, kernel and burden test statistics and p-values. Kernel
    p-values are based on either Kuonen (1999) or Davies (1980) method.
    The burden statistic has a standard normal distribution, so the sign
    of the burden statistic gives information on the direction of
    association (positive value implies large burden score are positively 
    associated with larger trait values).  When a gene has only 1 variant, 
    the kernel test reduces to the burden test. In this instance, the
    kernel statistic (chi-square) is the square of the burden statistic
    (standard normal), with both having the same p-value. When a gene
    has no markers after removing zero-variance markers, the gene test
    stastistics and p-values are all NA. 
  }
  \item{save: }{If verbose.return was set to TRUE, a list containing the
    cleaned form of the data that was input to pedgene and is used
    in the tests: ped, geno, and map}
